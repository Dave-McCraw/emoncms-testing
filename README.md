emoncms-testing
===============

System (end to end) testing for emoncms

Be aware that this will create and delete feeds on the emoncms installation you point it at.

You just need to clone this onto a machine with access to the emoncms install and provide the path and API key in question to the perl script when running it. i.e.

    ./end_to_end_testing.pl
